This will install just a utility that by default fully deletes bin ,obj, folders and subfolders under the solution directory.
It will by default redirect the output to the VS Output window (QuietMode).  

It has an options under Tools --> Options --> KSS 
This is still under development in order to allow for a complete set of Tools to sit under it.
For the Clean Solution Tool - only the top part of the options in Options Page are currently implemented.
